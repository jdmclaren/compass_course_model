# compass_course_model
Simulates stepwise compass courses on a sphere including within step precision, to assess inaugural aerial migration routes

To run model, type "solve_comp_rte_species" in the MATLAB command window, and choose the species and error scenario according to the ensuin gpropmpts. 
The model runs and automatically stores the output in the folder "output_species_runs/xx_yy_zz_aa_deg_errs/spec_name" where xx is the detection (compass) precision, 
yy the precision of cue transfer,zz of cue maintenance, aa the hourly drift, and spec_name the user-chosen name of the model species chosen in the prompts.

The folder "scripts_for_Figs" contains scripts to execute the Figures found in the manuscript.
